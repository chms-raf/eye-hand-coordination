% Order of Conditions:
%       1) Eye Alone No Feedback
%       2) Eye Alone Feedback
%       3) Eye Hand No Feedback
%       4) Eye Hand Feedback

% Notes:
%   - Subject said he/she missed a couple targets. They appeared outside the field
%       of view so he/she thought they dissappeared.
%   - For the feedback trials, I felt subject at first just looked and reached
%       at the target normally, and then adjusted head slightly to correct
%       the cursor position.

% Subject Responses:
%   Q: What strategy did you use to correct cursor position (Eye Alone Feedback)?
%   A: Used head movements for majority of movement, and a little of eyes to
%       fine tune the movement. Subject also thought the targets
%       at the center are easier to correct for than the targets on the
%       outside.
%   Q: Any other thoughts on the experiment?
%   A: Subject felt it was much easier to use head to move cursor than eyes.
%       Subject thought the eye data was noisy so it was difficult to control.
%   A: Subject suggested measuring the head data as well and comparing it to the
%       eye data. That way you could see how much the eye data is helping
%       to achieve target positions, if it is helping at all.
