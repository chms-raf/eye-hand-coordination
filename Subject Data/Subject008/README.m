% Order of Conditions:
%       1) Eye Alone Feedback
%       2) Eye Hand Feedback
%       3) Eye Hand No Feedback
%       4) Eye Alone No Feedback

% Notes:
%   - It was difficult to apply the image processing. The iSCAN seemed to
%       struggle at times to track the pupils and corneal reflections. This
%       could result in a lot of dropped data.
%   - When subject blinked, the cursor deviated greatly from its normal
%       position. I think this is due to the large amount of washout the image
%       processing produced on the eyelids/eyelashes. Blink trials my be
%       frequent.
%   - We had to redo the first trial beacuse glasses had to be
%       readjusted and we had to re-calibrate
%   - Subject didn't move head very much
%   - Subject said he/she got fatigued during the eye hand feedback condtion at
%       around 40 reaches.

% Subject Responses:
%   Q: What strategy did you use to correct cursor position (Eye Alone Feedback)?
%   A: Used head movements more to focus the cursor on the target.
%       Especially on the targets on the right side of screen
%   Q: Any other thoughts on the experiment?
%   A: Subject thought it was easier with hand (eye hand feedback) and took
%       less effort.
