% Order of Conditions:
%       1) Eye Alone No Feedback
%       2) Eye Hand Feedback
%       3) Eye Hand No Feedback
%       4) Eye Alone Feedback

% Notes:
%   - On the lower targets, the subject's corneal reflection was not
%       visible a lot of the time. Subject did not move head much so
%       eyelids blocked the CR a lot of the time.
%   - I think this happened a lot especially in the EyeAloneFeedback case
%       early on. I think subject figured out how to avoid it though later. I am
%       guessing this probably happened in the no feedback cases too.

% Subject Responses:
%   Q: What strategy did you use to correct cursor position (Eye Alone Feedback)?
%   A: Targets on the right side were easier to get the cursor to the
%       center. Tried moving head and didn't feel that was very helpful.
%       Subject moved eyes down the lines of the crosshair to move in the
%       direction he/she wanted. Also, reaching might have been easier for the
%       feedback case because subject could use finger as a guide of where to
%       look.
%   Q: Any other thoughts on the experiment?
%   A: Subject said it was surprising how difficult it was to achieve the
%       target position with the cursor. Subject thought it was easier when he/she
%       could use finger because then it provided points to focus on to
%       move gaze rather than just picking spots on the black screen.
