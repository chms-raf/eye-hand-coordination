% Order of Conditions:
%       1) Eye Hand Feedback
%       2) Eye Alone No Feedback
%       3) Eye Alone Feedback
%       4) Eye Hand No Feedback

% Notes:
%   - When subject reaches, subject curls finger a bit when subject moves to a target. Sometimes I think the finger goes invisible because of this.
%   - Subject did not move head much so I think on some of the lower
%       targets, the eyes may have been less visible and might be noisier.
%       I noticed this the most at the end of the Eye Hand Feedback
%       condition.

% Subject Responses:
%   Q: What strategy did you use to correct cursor position (Eye Alone Feedback)?
%   A: Subject kept eyes on the center of the target for the most part and
%       used slight head adjustments to correct the cursor. Subject said it was
%       "smoother" to use head than eyes.
%
%   Q: Any other thoughts on the experiment?
%   A: Reflections in the tv were somewhat distracting. Might be better to
%       have a white background with a black target
